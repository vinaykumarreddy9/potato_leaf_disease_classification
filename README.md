#Potato Leaf Disease Classification

#Project Overview :

The Potato Leaf Disease Classification project is a deep learning-based application designed to identify and classify various diseases affecting potato leaves. This project leverages image data of potato leaves and utilizes a trained neural network model to accurately predict the health status of a plant, aiding farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection and crop management.

#Features: 

Disease Detection: Classifies common potato leaf diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.
Deep Learning Model: Built using state-of-the-art neural networks trained on a large dataset of labeled potato leaf images.
User-Friendly: Provides a simple interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.
Scalable: Can be adapted to classify diseases in other crops with suitable training data.
